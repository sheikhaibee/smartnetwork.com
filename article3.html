                          <h2>What is <em>Trading strategy? </em></h2>
                            <p>A trading strategy is simply a plan you follow when executing trades. There is no single correct approach to trading, so
                            each strategy will largely depend on the trader's profile and preferences.
                            
                            Regardless of your approach to trading, establishing a plan is crucial it outlines clear goals and can prevent you
                            from going off course due to emotion. Typically, you will want to decide what you are trading, how you are going to trade
                            it, and the points at which you will enter and exit.
                            
                            In the following chapter, we will get into a few examples of popular trading strategies.
                            </p>
                          <h2>What is <em>portfolio management?</em></h2>
     
                          <p>Portfolio management concerns itself with the creation and handling of a collection of investments. The portfolio itself
                          is a grouping of assets – it could contain anything from Beanie Babies to real estate. If you’re exclusively trading
                          cryptocurrencies, then it will probably be made up of some combination of Bitcoin and other digital coins and tokens.
                          Your first step is to consider your expectations for the portfolio. Are you looking for a basket of investments that
                          will remain relatively protected from volatility, or something riskier that might bring higher returns in the short
                          term?            
                          Putting some thought into how you want to manage your portfolio is highly beneficial. Some might prefer a passive
                          strategy – one where you leave your investments alone after you set them up. Others could take an active approach, where
                          they continuously buy and sell assets to make profits.
                           </p>
                           <h2>What is risk management?</h2>
                              <P>
                                Managing risk is vital to success in trading. This begins with the identification of the types of risk you may
                                encounter:
                                
                                Market risk: the potential losses you could experience if the asset loses value.
                                
                                Liquidity risk: the potential losses arising from illiquid markets, where you cannot easily find buyers for your assets.
                                
                                Operational risk: the potential losses that stem from operational failures. These may be due to human error,
                                hardware/software failure, or intentional fraudulent conduct by employees.
                                
                                Systemic risk: the potential losses caused by the failure of players in the industry you operate in, which impacts all
                                businesses in that sector. As was the case in 2008, the collapse of the Lehman Brothers had a cascading effect on
                                worldwide financial systems.
                                
                                As you can see, risk identification begins with the assets in your portfolio, but it should take into account both
                                internal and external factors to be effective. Next, you’ll want to assess these risks. How often are you likely to
                                encounter them? How severe are they?
                                
                                By weighing up the risks and figuring out their possible impact on your portfolio, you can rank them and develop
                                appropriate strategies and responses. Systemic risk, for example, can be mitigated with diversification into different
                                investments, and market risk can be lessened with the use of stop-losses.

                                <h2>What is day trading?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Day trading is a strategy that involves entering and exiting positions within the same day. The term comes from legacy
                                    markets, referencing the fact that they’re only open for set periods during the day. Outside of those periods, day
                                    traders are not expected to keep any of their positions open.
                                    
                                    Cryptocurrency markets, as you probably know, are not subject to opening or closing times. You can trade around the
                                    clock every day of the year. Still, day trading in the context of cryptocurrency tends to refer to a trading style where
                                    the trader enters and exits positions within 24 hours.
                                    
                                    In day trading, you’ll often rely on technical analysis to determine which assets to trade. Because profits in such a
                                    short period can be minimal, you may opt to trade across a wide range of assets to try and maximize your returns. That
                                    said, some might exclusively trade the same pair for years.
                                    
                                    This style is obviously a very active trading strategy. It can be highly profitable, but it carries with it a
                                    significant amount of risk. As such, day trading is generally better suited to experienced traders.
                                </p>

                                <h2>What is swing trading?</h2>
                                 
                                   <p>
                                    In swing trading, you’re still trying to profit off market trends, but the time horizon is longer – positions are
                                    typically held anywhere from a couple of days to a couple of months.
                                    
                                    Often, your goal will be to identify an asset that looks undervalued and is likely to increase in value. You would
                                    purchase this asset, then sell it when the price rises to generate a profit. Or you can try to find overvalued assets
                                    that are likely to decrease in value. Then, you could sell some of them at a high price, hoping to buy them back for a
                                    lower price.
                                    
                                    As with day trading, many swing traders use technical analysis. However, because their strategy plays out across a
                                    longer period, fundamental analysis may also be a valuable tool.
                                    
                                    Swing trading tends to be a more beginner-friendly strategy. Mainly because it doesn’t come with the stress of
                                    fast-paced day trading. Where the latter is characterized by rapid decision-making and a lot of screen time, swing
                                    trading allows you to take your time.
                                   </p>

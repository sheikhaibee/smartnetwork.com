        <div id="Paragraph body 22">
<p>Trading is a fundamental economic concept that involves buying and selling assets. 
  These can be goods and services, where the buyer pays the compensation to the seller. In other cases,
   the transaction can involve the exchange of goods and services between the trading parties.</p>
<p>In the context of the financial markets, the assets being traded are called financial instruments. 
  These can be stocks, bonds, currency pairs on the Forex market, options, futures, margin products, cryptocurrency, and many others. 
  If these terms are new to you, do not worry we will explain them all later in this article.</p>
<p>The term trading is commonly used to refer to short-term trading, where traders actively enter and exit positions over relatively short time frames. 
  However, this is a slightly misleading assumption. In fact, trading may refer to a wide range of different strategies, such as day trading, swing trading, trend trading, and many others. 
  But do not worry. We will go through each of them in more detail later.</p>
 <h2>What is Investing</h2>
<p>Investing is allocating resources (such as capital) with the expectation of generating a profit. 
  This can include using money to fund and kickstart a business or buying land with the goal of reselling it later at a higher price. 
  In the financial markets, 
  this typically involves investing in financial instruments with the hopes of selling them later at a higher price.</p>
<p>The expectation of a return is core to the concept of investment (this is also known as ROI). 
  As opposed to trading, investing typically takes a longer-term approach to wealth accrual. 
  The goal of an investor is to build wealth over a long period of time (years, or even decades). 
  There are plenty of ways to do that, 
  but investors will typically use fundamental factors to find potentially good investment opportunities.</p>
  <h2>What is Fundamental Analysis (FA)?</h2>
<p>Fundamental analysis is a method for assessing a financial asset's valuation. 
  A fundamental analyst studies both economic and financial factors to determine if the value of an asset is fair. 
  These can include macroeconomic circumstances like the state of the wider economy, industry conditions, 
  or the business connected to the asset (if there's one). 
  And these are often tracked through macroeconomics leading and lagging indicators.</p>
<p>In the case of cryptocurrencies, fundamental analysis may also include an emerging field of data science that concerns itself with public blockchain data called on-chain metrics. 
  These metrics can include the network hash rate, the top holders, the number of addresses, 
  analysis of transactions, and many more. Using the abundance of available data on public blockchains, 
  analysts can create complex technical indicators that measure certain aspects of the overall health of the network.</p>
<p>While fundamental analysis is widely used in the stock market or Forex, it's less suitable for cryptocurrencies in their current state. 
  This asset class is so new that there simply isn't a standardized, comprehensive framework for determining market valuations. What's more, much of the market is driven by speculation and narratives. 
  As such, fundamental factors will typically have negligible effects on the price of a cryptocurrency. 
  However, more accurate ways to think about crypto asset valuation may be developed once the market matures.</p>
  <h2>What is Technical Analysis (TA)?</h2>
<p>Technical analysts work with a different approach. The core idea behind technical analysis is that historical price action may indicate how the market is likely to behave in the future.</p>
<p>Technical analysts don't try to find out the intrinsic value of an asset. 
  Instead, they look at the historical trading activity and try to identify opportunities based on that. This can include analysis of price action and volume, chart patterns, the use of technical indicators, and many other charting tools. 
  The goal of this analysis is to evaluate a given market's strength or weakness.</p>
<p>With that said, technical analysis isn't only a tool for predicting the probabilities of future price movements. It can also be a useful framework for risk management. Since technical analysis provides a model for analyzing market structure, 
it makes managing trades more defined and measurable. In this context, measuring risk is the first step to managing it. This is why some technical analysts may not be considered strictly traders. 
  They may use technical analysis purely as a framework for risk management.</p>
<p>The practice of technical analysis can be applied to any financial market, and it's widely used among cryptocurrency traders. 
  But does technical analysis work? Well, as we've mentioned earlier, 
  the valuation of the cryptocurrency markets is largely driven by speculation. 
  This makes them an ideal playing field for technical analysts, as they can thrive by only considering technical factors.</p>
  <h2>Fundamental analysis vs Technical analysis - which is better?</h2>
<P>That entirely depends on your trading strategy. Actually, why not use both? Most market analysis methods work best when they are combined with other methods or indicators. This way, there is a bigger chance of finding more reliable investment opportunities. 
Combining different trading strategies can also help eliminate biases from your decision-making process.This concept is sometimes referred to as confluence. Confluence traders combine multiple strategies into one that harnesses benefits from all of them. 
The idea is that the trading opportunities presented by the combined strategies may be stronger than the ones provided by only one strategy.</P>
  <h2>What is a market trend?</h2>
<p>A market trend is the overall direction where the price of an asset is going. In technical analysis, market trends are typically identified using price action, trend lines, or even key moving averages.
 Generally, there are two main types of market trends: bull and bear market. A bull market consists of a sustained uptrend, where prices are continually going up. A bear market consists of a sustained downtrend, where prices are continually going down. 
 In addition, we can also identify consolidating, or “sideways” markets, where there is not a clear directional trend.
</p>
<p>Bitcoin price chart since creation</p>
 <p>Bitcoin has been in a bull market throughout all its existence.</p>
  <h2>What is a market cycle?</h2>
<p>You may have heard the phrase that “the market moves in cycles”. A cycle is a pattern or trend that emerges at different times. Typically, market cycles on higher time frames are more reliable than market cycles on lower time frames. Even so, 
  you can eventually find small market cycles on an hourly chart just as you may do when looking at decades of data.
  Markets are cyclical in nature. Cycles can result in certain asset classes outperforming others. In other segments of the same market cycle, those same asset classes may underperform other types of assets due to the different market conditions.
  It is worth noting that it is almost impossible to determine in any given moment where we currently are in a market cycle. This analysis can be done with high accuracy only after that part of the cycle has concluded. 
  Market cycles also rarely have concrete beginning and endpoints. As it turns out, being in the present moment is an exceptionally biased viewpoint in the financial markets.
  If you would like to read more about market cycles, check out The Psychology of Market Cycles.</p>
   <h2>What drives the financial markets?</h2>
<p>The price of an asset is simply determined by the balance of supply and demand. In other words, it is decided by the buyers and sellers. Where supply meets demand, there is a market. But what else can drive the value of a financial asset?
 As we have discussed earlier, there can be fundamental factors, such as the state of the economy. In addition, there can be technical factors like the market capitalization of a cryptocurrency. Also, there may be other factors to consider, 
 such as market sentiment or recent news.
 However, these are just that factors to consider. What really determines the price of an asset in a given moment is simply the balance of supply and demand.</p>
 <h2>What is financial instrument?</h2>
 <p>In simple terms, a financial instrument is a tradable asset. Examples include cash, precious metals (like gold or silver), 
   a document that confirms ownership of something (like a business or a resource), a right to deliver or receive cash, and many others. 
   Financial instruments can be really complex, but the basic idea is that whatever they are or whatever they represent, they can be traded.

   Financial instruments have various types based on different classification methods. One of the classifications is based on whether they are cash instruments or derivative instruments. 
   As the name would suggest, derivative instruments derive their value from something else (like a cryptocurrency). Financial instruments may also be classified as debt-based or equity-based.
   
   But where do cryptocurrencies fall? We could think of them in multiple ways, and they could fit into more than one category. The simplest classification is that they are digital assets. However, 
   the potential of cryptocurrencies lies in building an entirely new financial and economic system.
   
   In this sense, cryptocurrencies form a completely new category of digital assets. What is more, as the ecosystem evolves, many new categories may be established that would not otherwise be possible. 
   Early examples of this can already be seen in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space.</p>
               <h2>What is the spot market?</h2>
     <p>The spot market is where financial instruments are traded for what is called “immediate delivery”. Delivery, in this context, simply means exchanging the financial instrument for cash. 
       This may seem like an unnecessary distinction, but some markets are not settled in cash instantly. For example, when we’re talking about the futures markets, the assets are delivered at a later date (when the futures contract expires).

       In simple terms, you could think of a spot market as the place where trades are made “on the spot.” Since the trades are settled immediately, the current market price of an asset is often referred to as the spot price.
       
       So, what does this mean in the context of cryptocurrency markets? What can you do on the Binance spot market? You can exchange coins with each other. So, if you want to exchange your BNB to BUSD, you go to the BNB/BUSD spot market, and voilá! In the same way, if you would like to exchange your BNB to BTC, you would go to the BNB/BTC spot market. Once your orders are filled, your coins will be swapped instantly. This is one of the easiest ways of trading cryptocurrencies.</p>
          <h2>What is margin trading?</h2>
        <p>Margin trading is a method of trading using borrowed funds from a third party. In effect, trading on margin amplifies results both to the upside and the downside. A margin account gives traders more access to capital and eliminates some counter party risk. How so? Well, traders can trade the same position size but keep less capital on the cryptocurrency exchange.

         When it comes to margin trading, you will often hear the terms margin and leverage. Margin refers to the amount of capital you commit (i.e., put up from your own pocket). Leverage means the amount that you amplify your margin with. So, if you use 2x leverage, it means that you open a position that is double the amount of your margin. If you use 4x leverage, you open a position that is four times the value of your margin, and so on.
         
         However, be aware of liquidation. The higher leverage you use, the closer the liquidation price is to your entry. If you get liquidated, you’ll risk losing your entire margin. So, be very aware of the high risks of trading on margin before getting started. The Binance Margin Trading Guide is an essential resource before you get started.
         
         Margin trading is widely used in stock, commodity, and Forex trading, as well as the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets. In a more traditional setting, the funds borrowed are provided by an investment broker. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the funds are typically lent by the exchange in return for a funding fee. In some other cases, however, the borrowed funds may come directly from other traders on the platform. This will usually incur a variable interest rate (funding fee),
          as the rate is determined by an open marketplace.
         
         So, we have briefly explained what margin trading is, but there is always more to learn.</p>
            <h2>What is derivatives market?</h2>
        <p>Derivatives are financial assets that base their value on something else. This can be an underlying asset or basket of assets. The most common types are stocks, bonds, commodities, market indexes, or cryptocurrencies.

         The derivative product itself is essentially a contract between multiple parties. It gets its price from the underlying asset that’s used as the benchmark. Whatever asset is used as this reference point, the core concept is that the derivative product derives its value from it. Some common examples of derivatives products are futures contracts, options contracts, and swaps.
         
         According to some estimates, the derivatives market is one of the biggest markets out there. How so? Well, derivatives can exist for virtually any financial product – even derivatives themselves. Yes, derivatives can be created from derivatives. And then, derivatives can be created from those derivatives, and so on. Does this sound like a shaky house of cards ready to come crashing down? Well, this may not be so far from the truth. Some argue that the derivatives market played a major part in the 2008 Financial Crisis.</p>    
            <h2>What are forward and futures contracts?</h2>
        <p>A futures contract is a type of derivatives product that allows traders to speculate on the future price of an asset. It involves an agreement between parties to settle the transaction at a later date called the expiry date. As we’ve discussed with derivatives, the underlying asset for a contract like this can be any asset. Common examples include cryptocurrency, commodities, stocks, and bonds.

          The expiration date of a futures contract is the last day that trading activity is ongoing for that specific contract. At the end of that day, the contract expires to the last traded price. The settlement of the contract is determined beforehand, and it can be either cash-settled or physically-delivered.
          
          When it’s delivered physically, the underlying asset of the contract is directly exchanged. For example, barrels of oil are delivered. When it’s settled in cash, the underlying asset isn’t exchanged directly, only the value that it represents (in the form of cash or cryptocurrency).

             <h2>What are perpetual futures contracts?</h2>
          <p>Futures products are a great way for traders to speculate on the price of an asset. However, what if they want to remain in their position even after the expiry date?

            Enter perpetual futures contracts. The main difference between them and a regular futures contract is that they never expire. This way, traders can speculate on the price of the underlying asset without having to worry about expiration. 
            
            However, this presents a problem of its own. What if the price of the perpetual futures contract gets really far from the price of the underlying asset? Since there’s no expiry date, the perpetual futures market could have a significant, continual disparity with the spot market.
            
            This is why perpetual futures contracts implement a funding fee that’s paid between traders. Let’s imagine that the perpetual futures market is trading higher than the spot market. In this case, the funding rate will be positive, meaning that long positions (buyers) pay the funding fees to short positions (sellers). This encourages buyers to sell, which then causes the price of the contract to drop, moving it closer to the spot price. Conversely, if the perpetual futures market is trading lower than the spot market, the funding rate will be negative. This time, shorts pay longs to incentivize pushing up the price of the contract. 
            
            To summarize, if funding is positive, longs pay shorts. If funding is negative, shorts pay longs.
            
            Perpetual futures contracts are hugely popular among Bitcoin and cryptocurrency traders. If you’d like to read more about perpetual futures contracts, check out What Are Perpetual Futures Contracts?.
            </p>
               <h2>What are options contracts?</h2>
          <p>An options contract is a type of derivatives product that gives traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an asset in the future at a specific price. The main difference between a futures contract and an options contract is that traders are not obligated to settle options contracts.

            When traders buy an options contract, they speculate on the price going in a direction. 
            
            There are two types of options contracts: call options and put options. A call option bets on the price going up, while a put option bets on the price going down.
            
            As with other derivatives products, options contracts can be based on a wide variety of financial assets: market indexes, commodities, stocks, cryptocurrencies, and so on.
            
            Options contracts can enable highly complex trading strategies and risk management methods, such as hedging. In the context of cryptocurrencies, options might be the most useful for miners who want to hedge their large cryptocurrency holdings. This way, they are better protected against events that could have a detrimental impact on their funds.

               <h2>What is the foreign exchange (Forex) market?</h2>
          <p>The foreign exchange (Forex, FX) market is where traders can exchange one country's currency into another. In essence, the Forex market is what determines the exchange rates for currencies around the world.

            We may often think of currencies as “safe haven” assets. Even the term “stablecoin” should imply, in theory, that the asset is somehow safe from volatility. However, while this is true to some extent, currencies can also experience significant market fluctuations. How come? Well, the value of currencies is also determined by supply and demand. In addition, they may also be influenced by inflation or other market forces related to global trade and investment, and geopolitical factors.
            
            How does the Forex market work? Well, currency pairs may be traded by investment banks, central banks, commercial companies, investment firms, hedge funds, and retail Forex traders. The Forex market also enables global currency conversions for international trade settlements.
            
            Forex traders will typically use day trading strategies, such as scalping with leverage, to amplify their returns. We will cover how exactly that works later in this article.
            
            The Forex market is one of the major building blocks of the modern global economy as we know it. In fact, the Forex market is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world.
            </p>
          <h2>What are leveraged tokens?</h2>
        <p>Leveraged tokens are tradable assets that can give you leveraged exposure to the price of a cryptocurrency without the usual requirements of managing a leveraged position. This means you do not have to worry about margin, collateral, funding, and liquidation.

          Leveraged tokens are an innovative financial product that only exist thanks to the power of blockchain. Leveraged tokens were initially introduced by derivatives exchange FTX, but since then have seen various alternative implementations. The main idea behind them, however, is still the same tokenizing open leveraged positions. What does this mean?
          
          Leveraged tokens represent open perpetual futures positions in a tokenized form. Remember when we discussed how derivatives can be created from derivatives? Leveraged tokens are a prime example since they derive their value from futures positions, which are also derivatives.
          
          Leveraged tokens are a great way to get a simple leveraged exposure to a cryptocurrency. If you would like to trade them on Binance, check out A Beginner's Guide to Binance Leveraged Tokens (BLVT).

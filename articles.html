        <h2>Crypto Currency</h2>
        <p>
        Cryptocurrency comes under many names. You have probably read about some of the most popular
      types of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,
      Litecoin, and Ethereum. Cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular alternatives for online payments. 
      Before converting real dollars, euros, pounds,
      or other traditional currencies into â‚¿ (the symbol for Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency) 
      you should understand:
      <h4>What Crypto Currencies are</h4>
      <h4>What are the <em>risks</em>in using Crypto Currencies</h4>
      <h4>How to protect your investment</h4>
        <div>
    </p>
    <h2>What is Crypto Currency?</h2>
    <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment created using encryption algorithms</p>
    <p>The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system. 
      To use cryptocurrencies,
       you need a cryptocurrency wallet. These wallets can be software that is a cloud-based service or is stored on your computer or 
       on your mobile device. 
       The wallets are the tool through which you store your encryption keys that confirm your identity and link to your cryptocurrency.</p>
      

    <h2>What are the risks in using Crypto Currencies?</h2>
    <p>Cryptocurrencies are still relatively new, and the market for these digital currencies is very volatile.</p>
    <p>Since cryptocurrencies don't need banks or any other third party to regulate them; they tend to be uninsured
       and are hard to convert into a form of tangible currency (such as US dollars or euros.) In addition, since cryptocurrencies 
       are technology-based intangible assets, they can be hacked like any other intangible technology asset.
      Finally, since you store your cryptocurrencies in a digital wallet, if you lose your wallet (or access to it or to wallet backups),
       you have lost your entire cryptocurrency investment.</p>

    <h2>How to protect your investment</h2>
     <p>
     When it comes to investing in cryptocurrency, there are a few things you can do to protect your investment. First and foremost, 
     it is important to remember that cryptocurrency is a volatile market, and prices can fluctuate dramatically. 
     This means that you could see big gains or losses in a short period. For this reason, 
     it is important to have a solid investment strategy in place before you invest.</p>


<p>Once you have a strategy in place, there are a few other things you can do to protect your investment. One is to diversify your portfolio. Do not put all of your eggs in one basket, so to speak. 
Spread your investment across different types of cryptocurrency, and different projects within the space. 
This way, if one project fails, your entire investment does not go down with it.</p>           
<p>Another thing you can do is keep your cryptocurrency in a secure wallet. There are many different types of wallets available, so choose one that fits your needs. 
Once you have a wallet set up, make sure to keep your recovery phrase safe and secure. This phrase will allow you to recover your funds if you lose access to your wallet for any reason. 
Consider buying your cryptocurrency through Binance.</p>
     
     
<p>Finally, stay up-to-date on news and developments in the cryptocurrency space. This will help you identify potential opportunities, and avoid any potential pitfalls.</p>
